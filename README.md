Creator's Note
----------
This project is one of my first "programming" projects (As are most of my Gamemaker projects). The project can probably be done better, but I still wanted to upload it. It works and it's a good starting point for beginners or to get a prototype quickly running.

Features
----------
- Self-spreading and burning fire
- Objects are damaged and destroyed by flames
- Adjustable flammability percentage

Instructions
----------
1. Download the project folder from this page.
2. Start Gamemaker Studio 2.
3. Open the .yyp file inside the project folder in Gamemaker Studio 2.
4. Get creative!

Credits
----------
Full project (including the pixel art) has been made by me RanDB.  Although crediting me is appreciated, it is not required. However, please do not claim any of my pixel art as your own.
